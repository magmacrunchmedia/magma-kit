/* Came up from deck-forge with the module. The only change is that the store
   is a factory now, so each test constructs its own rather than resetting a
   singleton — which is also what stops these tests leaking into each other.

   The assertion that matters most is the last one: adopt() re-seeding the ref
   counter. A file holding img1..img9 loaded into a store whose counter is 0
   would have the next import allocate img1, and register() would hand back the
   LOADED art, so the element silently shows the wrong picture. */
